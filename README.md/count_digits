Simple Iterative Solution to count digits in an integer
The integer entered by the user is stored in the variable n. Then the while loop is iterated until the test expression n != 0 is evaluated to 0 (false).   We will consider 3456 as the input integer.  

After the first iteration, the value of n will be updated to 345 and the count is incremented to 1.
After the second iteration, the value of n will be updated to 34 and the count is incremented to 2.
After the third iteration, the value of n will be updated to 3 and the count is incremented to 3.
In the fourth iteration, the value of n will be updated to zero and the count will be incremented to 4.  
Then the test expression is evaluated ( n!=0 ) as false and the loop terminates with final count as 4.
